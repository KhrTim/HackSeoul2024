        "Jumping into the number five spot of the best mechanical keyboards of 2024 is the AO 5075 B+, coming in at a price tag of $99.99. If you want to check out any of the five keyboards in this video, there are Amazon links below for the US, UK, Canada, and international links. But let's jump into the AO 5075 B+ now. This is a 75% form factor that has a two-piece plastic case design that does have quite a bit of flex, but also has bright and well-diffused RGB accents on the sides. There's dongle storage on the rear and a knob with tactile bumps. This is also gasket mounted and for dampening, there is silicone in the case, a switch dampening pad, as well as more silicone between the plate and the PCB. This is very nice. The dampening makes the sound high quality, and overall I like the way it sounds; it sounds very ACO. But when picking up the case, it doesn't feel super expensive, and that's really the only reason that it's in the number five spot. The plastics do feel cheaper, but the overall product, the typing experience, and the sound of it are great, so it's kind of hard to knock that, but also it is what it is.\n",
        "\n",
        "Now switches are a big reason that this keyboard made it onto the list. These use AO's own switches and you have a choice between AO's V3 cream yellow Pros which are linear, V3 cream blue Pro switches which are tactiles, and the V3 silver Pros which is what I have, and probably my favorite for this keyboard. The silvers have a fantastic bottom-out feel, that's really quite nice for both gaming and typing. They are a lighter linear switch that's probably the most suited for gaming of the AO lineup, or definitely in that category of a great gaming switch. They are smooth, and really I don't think anyone will be unhappy with these switch options. But if you do end up wanting to change your switches out, this is fully hot swappable with three and five-pin switches.\n",
        "\n",
        "As for keycaps, this is classic AO. They use their ASA profile keycaps here, they are double shot PBT for these are great keycaps. They have nice printing, great thickness, and a slightly grippy texture. Overall, a really nice set of keycaps for this price point. However, if you've ever had an AO keyboard before, this is nothing new, so this might not even make it onto your choice because well, AO really hasn't updated these keycaps or changed anything really over the last couple of years, which isn't a bad thing. This is a fantastic option, but if you want something new and you already have AO's ASA profile keycaps, you might not be as attracted to this option.\n",
        "\n",
        "Now let's talk stabilizers. These are very well-tuned as well as being lubed from the factory, with only a slight tick on the backspace specifically. Overall, very good. I really like AO's purple stabilizers; these are great. But don't take my word for it, take a listen to the sound test. And that is how it sounds. Also, stick around to the end of the video for a back-to-back sound test of all the keyboards.\n",
        "\n",
        "Now for connectivity, this is wired with a USB type C or wireless with Bluetooth 5.0, or wireless for gaming with a 2.4 GHz USB dongle. So, you have pretty much every option there. And the cherry on top of all that is this has south-facing LEDs. So, overall, a great keyboard to mod with. Really, the only con being that the case does feel a little bit cheap and it's a little bit flexible, although that might actually be better for the feeling of the keyboard on the desk. Who knows? I think it may add to it.\n",
        "\n",
        "Lastly, the RGB here is great. It's nice and bright and vibrant. There's tons of modes, there's static colors, it's per-key lighting, it's exactly what you'd expect here. But with that, let's move on to the number four spot, and that is the Royal Axe R100, coming in at a price tag of $99.99. You get a lot for your money here. Now this switches it up to a 95% form factor which is fantastic if you want basically all of the keys you're going to need but you still want a more compact design so that you have more desk space. Maybe for like a larger mouse pad or just other things on your desk. However, you can also get this exact same keyboard in different form factors; you can get this in a full-size TKL and even a 65%, although I do think the 95% is just kind of the coolest one.\n",
        "\n",
        "Now for the build, the case is a single plastic shell with a top bump on the rear to act as a riser that also has integrated dongle storage which is super nice to access the dongle with the keyboard sitting on your desk without visually like messing up the design. So, you literally just have the keyboard on, pull it out, very very good. It then has swooping designs on the sides as well as glossy accents and finally, there is a switch for Mac versus Windows as well as a gold knob/switch thing for toggling between different connection modes, which is very very satisfying to click. That'll be in the sound test coming up. Overall, it's unique and it looks custom, definitely more so than the AO. Really, the only con I can see with the build as it feels solid, is because of the design for the bump out, this is consistently in a slightly raised-up angle. So if you do prefer a flatter keyboard, there's no adjustability there, and really that's the only con with the build. Now, as for dampening, there's some silicone between the plate and the PCB. Now colorways here are actually very cool. You saw I got that kind of like brown gold one which I think looks sick, but there's others: Whale Blue, Night Crimson, and Starry Cyan. The one that I got was the Lava Brown, so there's definitely a lot for I would say most people's preferences. If you definitely like a louder keyboard that's very very cool and custom looking, this one definitely delivers.\n",
        "\n",
        "Switches here use the Gaton G Pro 3.0 yellow switches. They are preed with an actuation force of 50 g, so they are a bit heavier than your traditional red switch but not by a crazy amount. They have some scratchiness but overall they are really really nice feeling. Overall, I'm happy with the switches, I think they match the keyboard pretty well. But if you want to get into modifying it, absolutely can because this is fully hot swappable with three and five-pin switches.\n",
        "\n",
        "Now for keycaps, the keycaps I believe are AK profile. They have great printing and a really nice thickness as well as a matte finish, kind of grippy texture. Overall, very satisfying for typing. Now let's talk stabilizers. The stabs are heavily lubed but not overdone, and they're tight in the plate, and honestly, they're tuned perfectly from the factory with no ticks or rattles. This has a slightly muted, creamy sound that I really really enjoy. But don't take my word for it, take a listen to the sound test. And that is how it sounds.\n",
        "\n",
        "Now as for connectivity, you can obviously use this with a USB type-C cable in its wired format or wirelessly with Bluetooth 5.0 or a 2.4 GHz USB dongle for gaming to get that high polling rate. As for RGBs, this does have North-facing LEDs, but the RGB is very bright and vibrant, has tons of modes, static colors are great, especially that orange. Just overall, very attractive. So, if you did want to do some sort of shine-through keycap, this is definitely a great option for that. But with that, let's move on to the number three spot, and this is the Apil Maker Brick 87, coming in at a price tag of $109.99. This is a very special keyboard. Obviously, by the name, it is Brick, so Legos, although not licensed I don't think. Now, this is a TKL form factor and is overall a super cool, quirky keyboard especially if you are a Lego lover like me. You can literally build off of your keyboard, like literally build off of it. The case is a two-piece plastic shell and there's a switch on the right side to switch connection modes and then one on the left to turn it on and off. Now one of the most interesting things is that this has two like roller scroll wheels on the bottom front chin of the keyboard. It's a very interesting place to put it, it's actually very cool. One of them is for volume control and the other one is for RGB brightness, uh, very cool integration, actually works pretty well. However, occasionally one of them gets a little bit stuck, so you kind of have to like push it a little bit harder, but you know it's cool that it's there. I'd rather have it than not have it. Then on top of that, you get that awesome glorious Lego bar which you can attach genuine Legos to it, and I did. Lego figures fit snugly and you can remove them if you want to totally customize it, so very very cool. Now, as for dampening, this has a ton of EVA foam in the case, a bunch of switch pads, a layer of cotton for more dampening between the plate and the PCB, and overall, I think they did a great job. I love the sound profile of this keyboard. It sounds like a custom, it sounds expensive, and it looks sweet, not only just because of the Lego bar but definitely some points up for that. For colorways, this actually comes in quite a few. You can get this in a clear Smokey black, a gray-green, a gray-pink, and then a white-purple. Now for switches, this uses EO Maker's own switches and I'm a fan of them. You have a choice between the Wisteria flamingos and Lily. These are all linear, or you can get Gaton Pro yellows. Now, of all those options, I would definitely pick EO makers over the Pro yellows, but I guess if you are a gamer, then yeah, you can get the yellows. I got the flamingos because I actually love the flamingos. I think it is an excellent switch for the price. However, there's no stock option for tactiles, so if you do want tactiles, you're going to have to modify it afterward. However, that's not a problem because obviously, this is fully compatible with three and five-pin switches. Now, all of these switches are factory lubed, and they did a great job here. It feels, feels, and sounds really good. The flamingos are definitely an enthusiast-grade switch; that's what I would call an enthusiast-grade switch, not like crazy crazy high but definitely in that realm. This is not like a budget budget switch. Now keycaps here, they are PBT with a very smooth texture and a matte finish. These again have a great thickness, though the printing is a little inconsistent in terms of like boldness. However, if you're not a stickler for that, the thickness on this does create a nice sound profile. The stabilizers here are well tuned and very well lubed. There is a very slight tick on the space bar, but that is slight. But overall, very well done. Don't take my word for it though, take a listen to the sound [Applause] test. And that is how it sounds. But with that, let's talk connectivity. You can use this wire with a USB type-C, wirelessly with Bluetooth 5.0, or a 2.4 GHz USB dongle. As for battery size, this has a 3,000 mAh battery. The RGB here is bright and well-diffused, there's tons of modes, static colors, it's really got everything you'd want, including south-facing LEDs which is not something I expected. But with that, let's move on to the number two spot, which is the Royal Cludge M75, coming at a price tag of $119.99. This is a 75% form factor, has a hefty two-piece plastic case with a metal knob, an extra USB-C when in wired mode, and a small OLED screen in the bottom right. The knob has nice tactile bumps and great functionality. When you press the knob, you can control the connectivity of the keyboard through the screen. The screen also shows battery, volume, as well as whether you're using Windows or Mac. Now for dampening, this is gasket mounted with foam between the polycarbonate plate and the PCB, a silicone switch dampening pad, and then a silicone mold in the case. Overall, very very good. I like the sound profile, which obviously sound test coming up. Now let's talk colorways, and there's a few things that we need to talk about with that. There is a purple which is the one that I have, which is the first release of this keyboard. Then there is a light gray, dark gray, or a green colorway. There are some notable updates to the other colorways such as south-facing LEDs and different switch and keycap options. Overall, it seems like they made better updates to the keyboard to make it even better for the price point, so I feel very confident recommending this keyboard even with the updated variation, especially if you want south-facing LEDs, a great thing to get. Now for switch options here, you have a choice between Browns which are obviously tactile, Reds, or speed Silvers, and that is for the purple colorway. For the other colorways, we have a choice between pale green switches which are tactile, or Vididian switches which are linear. The speed Silvers which I have are factory lubed. The switches here definitely have some scratchiness but overall not that scratchy and is a nice progressive feeling spring with a good weight, especially for gaming. As far as hot swap ability, this is fully hot swappable with three and five-pin switches. Keycaps here are double shot PBT non-shinethrough keycaps with side printing. The stabilizers here are very nicely tuned with no ticks or rattles. Overall, really impressed here. But don't take my word for a take a listen to the sound test. For connectivity, you can use this wire with a USB type-C or wirelessly with Bluetooth or a 2.4 GHz USB dongle. And as for the battery size, this is nicely sized at a 3,750 mAh battery. Now for RGB, because this uses a polycarbonate plate, it reflects the RGB quite nicely, making it very bright and vibrant. This also has tons of modes and colors and per-key lighting. And again, to reiterate, the purple colorway has North-facing LEDs and the other colorways have south-facing LEDs. But with that, moving on to the number one spot, this is the Yanai AL71, coming at a price tag of $99.99. This is the freaking steal of the century; an unbelievable keyboard, extraordinarily worthy of the number one spot. This uses a 68% form factor and for the build, there's a reason why this is in the number one spot. This has a two-piece solid aluminum shell. It is very heavy, solid, gasket-mounted, and it's got a decorative silver moon logo on the front right side, which I think looks great and really makes this feel more like a custom keyboard, which this really is. This is a custom keyboard. It also has side diffused RGB accents, which are actually pretty dang bright and look great, as well as a switch to toggle between Windows and Mac and another switch to change your connectivity modes. All the selections have nice tactile bumps and everything really on this keyboard just feels extremely premium and it sounds amazing. As for dampening, this also has a ton of switch pads, case dampening foam between the plate and the PCB. This has a lot of dampening, and because of that, it sounds nicely. Obviously, you can take out some of that if you want to change up the sound profile, which actually wouldn't be too hard because well, it's an aluminum case so it's a little bit easier to get into. For colorways, you actually have quite a few options which is kind of unexpected because the aluminum kind of you would expect that higher price point, but it's in a lower price point, not as many color options, but yeah it does well. You have a choice between black, blue, purple, green, pink, red, and silver. Now for switch options here, you have two options, you have the crystal white switches which is a lighter linear switch. I actually really liked them, or you have a silent switch. If you're really into the feel, the silent switches aren't going to be as great as they do have like a rubber stopper that does kind of soften the bottom out, so it's not going to feel as nice, but it sounds like basically no sound, still much better than a membrane keyboard but yeah, just take that into account. The crystals are very very smooth and have a great sound of them, so overall, I really enjoy this. However, since there's not a lot of switch options, if you do want to end up customizing your shelf and putting your own switches in there, it's fully hot swappable with three and five-pin switches. Now let's talk keycaps. These are PBT with a cherry profile, and that is something I really really enjoy. I like Cherry, it makes it feel more like a custom keyboard, which it is. I keep saying like a custom keyboard, This is a custom keyboard, let's be real. They have a slight texture to them, they're matte finish, and they have a good thickness. The stabs here are greased from the factory and are tuned very well, especially the space bar, guys I can't overdo that. You're going to hear in the sound test, really really good job. The only one with a slight issue was the backspace and has a slight tick but if you're not an enthusiast you may not even notice it's like that slight. Overall, I absolutely love the sound and feel of this board and for the price, you literally can't beat it, guys. There's a reason it's in the number one spot, but don't take my word for it, take a listen to the sound [Applause] test. And that is how it sounds. For connectivity, you can use this wire with a USB type-C or wirelessly with Bluetooth 5.0 or a 2.4 GHz USB dongle for gaming and on top of all of that, you're going to think okay, well the wireless connectivity, they're going to give you a small battery size, no, it's the biggest battery on the list. This uses a 4600 mAh battery, pretty freaking wild. For RGB, it's good here, it's bright, it's nice and vibrant, it's per-key lighting, it's pretty much exactly what you'd expect and again having those side RGB lights really adds a nice touch to it. And lastly, obviously because this has Cherry profile keycaps, this uses south-facing LEDs. What doesn't this keyboard have for this ridiculously good price tag? Again, if you want to check out any of the five keyboards in this video, there are Amazon links below for the US, UK, Canada, and international links. The AL71 absolutely blew me away, that is an unbelievable price for that keyboard. I really hope they don't increase the price because it seems too good to be true, but it is very good and it is true, at the time of filming. But yeah, this is Consumer Deck review, and I'll see you guys in the next one.\"\"\"\n",

        "Jumping into the number five spot of the best mechanical keyboards of 2024 is the AO 5075 B+, coming in at a price tag of $99.99. If you want to check out any of the five keyboards in this video, there are Amazon links below for the US, UK, Canada, and international links. But let's jump into the AO 5075 B+ now. This is a 75% form factor that has a two-piece plastic case design that does have quite a bit of flex, but also has bright and well-diffused RGB accents on the sides. There's dongle storage on the rear and a knob with tactile bumps. This is also gasket mounted and for dampening, there is silicone in the case, a switch dampening pad, as well as more silicone between the plate and the PCB. This is very nice. The dampening makes the sound high quality, and overall I like the way it sounds; it sounds very ACO. But when picking up the case, it doesn't feel super expensive, and that's really the only reason that it's in the number five spot. The plastics do feel cheaper, but the overall product, the typing experience, and the sound of it are great, so it's kind of hard to knock that, but also it is what it is.\n",
        "\n",
        "Now switches are a big reason that this keyboard made it onto the list. These use AO's own switches and you have a choice between AO's V3 cream yellow Pros which are linear, V3 cream blue Pro switches which are tactiles, and the V3 silver Pros which is what I have, and probably my favorite for this keyboard. The silvers have a fantastic bottom-out feel, that's really quite nice for both gaming and typing. They are a lighter linear switch that's probably the most suited for gaming of the AO lineup, or definitely in that category of a great gaming switch. They are smooth, and really I don't think anyone will be unhappy with these switch options. But if you do end up wanting to change your switches out, this is fully hot swappable with three and five-pin switches.\n",
        "\n",
        "As for keycaps, this is classic AO. They use their ASA profile keycaps here, they are double shot PBT for these are great keycaps. They have nice printing, great thickness, and a slightly grippy texture. Overall, a really nice set of keycaps for this price point. However, if you've ever had an AO keyboard before, this is nothing new, so this might not even make it onto your choice because well, AO really hasn't updated these keycaps or changed anything really over the last couple of years, which isn't a bad thing. This is a fantastic option, but if you want something new and you already have AO's ASA profile keycaps, you might not be as attracted to this option.\n",
        "\n",
        "Now let's talk stabilizers. These are very well-tuned as well as being lubed from the factory, with only a slight tick on the backspace specifically. Overall, very good. I really like AO's purple stabilizers; these are great. But don't take my word for it, take a listen to the sound test. And that is how it sounds. Also, stick around to the end of the video for a back-to-back sound test of all the keyboards.\n",
        "\n",
        "Now for connectivity, this is wired with a USB type C or wireless with Bluetooth 5.0, or wireless for gaming with a 2.4 GHz USB dongle. So, you have pretty much every option there. And the cherry on top of all that is this has south-facing LEDs. So, overall, a great keyboard to mod with. Really, the only con being that the case does feel a little bit cheap and it's a little bit flexible, although that might actually be better for the feeling of the keyboard on the desk. Who knows? I think it may add to it.\n",
        "\n",
        "Lastly, the RGB here is great. It's nice and bright and vibrant. There's tons of modes, there's static colors, it's per-key lighting, it's exactly what you'd expect here. But with that, let's move on to the number four spot, and that is the Royal Axe R100, coming in at a price tag of $99.99. You get a lot for your money here. Now this switches it up to a 95% form factor which is fantastic if you want basically all of the keys you're going to need but you still want a more compact design so that you have more desk space. Maybe for like a larger mouse pad or just other things on your desk. However, you can also get this exact same keyboard in different form factors; you can get this in a full-size TKL and even a 65%, although I do think the 95% is just kind of the coolest one.\n",
        "\n",
        "Now for the build, the case is a single plastic shell with a top bump on the rear to act as a riser that also has integrated dongle storage which is super nice to access the dongle with the keyboard sitting on your desk without visually like messing up the design. So, you literally just have the keyboard on, pull it out, very very good. It then has swooping designs on the sides as well as glossy accents and finally, there is a switch for Mac versus Windows as well as a gold knob/switch thing for toggling between different connection modes, which is very very satisfying to click. That'll be in the sound test coming up. Overall, it's unique and it looks custom, definitely more so than the AO. Really, the only con I can see with the build as it feels solid, is because of the design for the bump out, this is consistently in a slightly raised-up angle. So if you do prefer a flatter keyboard, there's no adjustability there, and really that's the only con with the build. Now, as for dampening, there's some silicone between the plate and the PCB. Now colorways here are actually very cool. You saw I got that kind of like brown gold one which I think looks sick, but there's others: Whale Blue, Night Crimson, and Starry Cyan. The one that I got was the Lava Brown, so there's definitely a lot for I would say most people's preferences. If you definitely like a louder keyboard that's very very cool and custom looking, this one definitely delivers.\n",
        "\n",
        "Switches here use the Gaton G Pro 3.0 yellow switches. They are preed with an actuation force of 50 g, so they are a bit heavier than your traditional red switch but not by a crazy amount. They have some scratchiness but overall they are really really nice feeling. Overall, I'm happy with the switches, I think they match the keyboard pretty well. But if you want to get into modifying it, absolutely can because this is fully hot swappable with three and five-pin switches.\n",
        "\n",
        "Now for keycaps, the keycaps I believe are AK profile. They have great printing and a really nice thickness as well as a matte finish, kind of grippy texture. Overall, very satisfying for typing. Now let's talk stabilizers. The stabs are heavily lubed but not overdone, and they're tight in the plate, and honestly, they're tuned perfectly from the factory with no ticks or rattles. This has a slightly muted, creamy sound that I really really enjoy. But don't take my word for it, take a listen to the sound test. And that is how it sounds.\n",
        "\n",
        "Now as for connectivity, you can obviously use this with a USB type-C cable in its wired format or wirelessly with Bluetooth 5.0 or a 2.4 GHz USB dongle for gaming to get that high polling rate. As for RGBs, this does have North-facing LEDs, but the RGB is very bright and vibrant, has tons of modes, static colors are great, especially that orange. Just overall, very attractive. So, if you did want to do some sort of shine-through keycap, this is definitely a great option for that. But with that, let's move on to the number three spot, and this is the Apil Maker Brick 87, coming in at a price tag of $109.99. This is a very special keyboard. Obviously, by the name, it is Brick, so Legos, although not licensed I don't think. Now, this is a TKL form factor and is overall a super cool, quirky keyboard especially if you are a Lego lover like me. You can literally build off of your keyboard, like literally build off of it. The case is a two-piece plastic shell and there's a switch on the right side to switch connection modes and then one on the left to turn it on and off. Now one of the most interesting things is that this has two like roller scroll wheels on the bottom front chin of the keyboard. It's a very interesting place to put it, it's actually very cool. One of them is for volume control and the other one is for RGB brightness, uh, very cool integration, actually works pretty well. However, occasionally one of them gets a little bit stuck, so you kind of have to like push it a little bit harder, but you know it's cool that it's there. I'd rather have it than not have it. Then on top of that, you get that awesome glorious Lego bar which you can attach genuine Legos to it, and I did. Lego figures fit snugly and you can remove them if you want to totally customize it, so very very cool. Now, as for dampening, this has a ton of EVA foam in the case, a bunch of switch pads, a layer of cotton for more dampening between the plate and the PCB, and overall, I think they did a great job. I love the sound profile of this keyboard. It sounds like a custom, it sounds expensive, and it looks sweet, not only just because of the Lego bar but definitely some points up for that. For colorways, this actually comes in quite a few. You can get this in a clear Smokey black, a gray-green, a gray-pink, and then a white-purple. Now for switches, this uses EO Maker's own switches and I'm a fan of them. You have a choice between the Wisteria flamingos and Lily. These are all linear, or you can get Gaton Pro yellows. Now, of all those options, I would definitely pick EO makers over the Pro yellows, but I guess if you are a gamer, then yeah, you can get the yellows. I got the flamingos because I actually love the flamingos. I think it is an excellent switch for the price. However, there's no stock option for tactiles, so if you do want tactiles, you're going to have to modify it afterward. However, that's not a problem because obviously, this is fully compatible with three and five-pin switches. Now, all of these switches are factory lubed, and they did a great job here. It feels, feels, and sounds really good. The flamingos are definitely an enthusiast-grade switch; that's what I would call an enthusiast-grade switch, not like crazy crazy high but definitely in that realm. This is not like a budget budget switch. Now keycaps here, they are PBT with a very smooth texture and a matte finish. These again have a great thickness, though the printing is a little inconsistent in terms of like boldness. However, if you're not a stickler for that, the thickness on this does create a nice sound profile. The stabilizers here are well tuned and very well lubed. There is a very slight tick on the space bar, but that is slight. But overall, very well done. Don't take my word for it though, take a listen to the sound [Applause] test. And that is how it sounds. But with that, let's talk connectivity. You can use this wire with a USB type-C, wirelessly with Bluetooth 5.0, or a 2.4 GHz USB dongle. As for battery size, this has a 3,000 mAh battery. The RGB here is bright and well-diffused, there's tons of modes, static colors, it's really got everything you'd want, including south-facing LEDs which is not something I expected. But with that, let's move on to the number two spot, which is the Royal Cludge M75, coming at a price tag of $119.99. This is a 75% form factor, has a hefty two-piece plastic case with a metal knob, an extra USB-C when in wired mode, and a small OLED screen in the bottom right. The knob has nice tactile bumps and great functionality. When you press the knob, you can control the connectivity of the keyboard through the screen. The screen also shows battery, volume, as well as whether you're using Windows or Mac. Now for dampening, this is gasket mounted with foam between the polycarbonate plate and the PCB, a silicone switch dampening pad, and then a silicone mold in the case. Overall, very very good. I like the sound profile, which obviously sound test coming up. Now let's talk colorways, and there's a few things that we need to talk about with that. There is a purple which is the one that I have, which is the first release of this keyboard. Then there is a light gray, dark gray, or a green colorway. There are some notable updates to the other colorways such as south-facing LEDs and different switch and keycap options. Overall, it seems like they made better updates to the keyboard to make it even better for the price point, so I feel very confident recommending this keyboard even with the updated variation, especially if you want south-facing LEDs, a great thing to get. Now for switch options here, you have a choice between Browns which are obviously tactile, Reds, or speed Silvers, and that is for the purple colorway. For the other colorways, we have a choice between pale green switches which are tactile, or Vididian switches which are linear. The speed Silvers which I have are factory lubed. The switches here definitely have some scratchiness but overall not that scratchy and is a nice progressive feeling spring with a good weight, especially for gaming. As far as hot swap ability, this is fully hot swappable with three and five-pin switches. Keycaps here are double shot PBT non-shinethrough keycaps with side printing. The stabilizers here are very nicely tuned with no ticks or rattles. Overall, really impressed here. But don't take my word for a take a listen to the sound test. For connectivity, you can use this wire with a USB type-C or wirelessly with Bluetooth or a 2.4 GHz USB dongle. And as for the battery size, this is nicely sized at a 3,750 mAh battery. Now for RGB, because this uses a polycarbonate plate, it reflects the RGB quite nicely, making it very bright and vibrant. This also has tons of modes and colors and per-key lighting. And again, to reiterate, the purple colorway has North-facing LEDs and the other colorways have south-facing LEDs. But with that, moving on to the number one spot, this is the Yanai AL71, coming at a price tag of $99.99. This is the freaking steal of the century; an unbelievable keyboard, extraordinarily worthy of the number one spot. This uses a 68% form factor and for the build, there's a reason why this is in the number one spot. This has a two-piece solid aluminum shell. It is very heavy, solid, gasket-mounted, and it's got a decorative silver moon logo on the front right side, which I think looks great and really makes this feel more like a custom keyboard, which this really is. This is a custom keyboard. It also has side diffused RGB accents, which are actually pretty dang bright and look great, as well as a switch to toggle between Windows and Mac and another switch to change your connectivity modes. All the selections have nice tactile bumps and everything really on this keyboard just feels extremely premium and it sounds amazing. As for dampening, this also has a ton of switch pads, case dampening foam between the plate and the PCB. This has a lot of dampening, and because of that, it sounds nicely. Obviously, you can take out some of that if you want to change up the sound profile, which actually wouldn't be too hard because well, it's an aluminum case so it's a little bit easier to get into. For colorways, you actually have quite a few options which is kind of unexpected because the aluminum kind of you would expect that higher price point, but it's in a lower price point, not as many color options, but yeah it does well. You have a choice between black, blue, purple, green, pink, red, and silver. Now for switch options here, you have two options, you have the crystal white switches which is a lighter linear switch. I actually really liked them, or you have a silent switch. If you're really into the feel, the silent switches aren't going to be as great as they do have like a rubber stopper that does kind of soften the bottom out, so it's not going to feel as nice, but it sounds like basically no sound, still much better than a membrane keyboard but yeah, just take that into account. The crystals are very very smooth and have a great sound of them, so overall, I really enjoy this. However, since there's not a lot of switch options, if you do want to end up customizing your shelf and putting your own switches in there, it's fully hot swappable with three and five-pin switches. Now let's talk keycaps. These are PBT with a cherry profile, and that is something I really really enjoy. I like Cherry, it makes it feel more like a custom keyboard, which it is. I keep saying like a custom keyboard, This is a custom keyboard, let's be real. They have a slight texture to them, they're matte finish, and they have a good thickness. The stabs here are greased from the factory and are tuned very well, especially the space bar, guys I can't overdo that. You're going to hear in the sound test, really really good job. The only one with a slight issue was the backspace and has a slight tick but if you're not an enthusiast you may not even notice it's like that slight. Overall, I absolutely love the sound and feel of this board and for the price, you literally can't beat it, guys. There's a reason it's in the number one spot, but don't take my word for it, take a listen to the sound [Applause] test. And that is how it sounds. For connectivity, you can use this wire with a USB type-C or wirelessly with Bluetooth 5.0 or a 2.4 GHz USB dongle for gaming and on top of all of that, you're going to think okay, well the wireless connectivity, they're going to give you a small battery size, no, it's the biggest battery on the list. This uses a 4600 mAh battery, pretty freaking wild. For RGB, it's good here, it's bright, it's nice and vibrant, it's per-key lighting, it's pretty much exactly what you'd expect and again having those side RGB lights really adds a nice touch to it. And lastly, obviously because this has Cherry profile keycaps, this uses south-facing LEDs. What doesn't this keyboard have for this ridiculously good price tag? Again, if you want to check out any of the five keyboards in this video, there are Amazon links below for the US, UK, Canada, and international links. The AL71 absolutely blew me away, that is an unbelievable price for that keyboard. I really hope they don't increase the price because it seems too good to be true, but it is very good and it is true, at the time of filming. But yeah, this is Consumer Deck review, and I'll see you guys in the next one.\"\"\"\n",

        "Jumping into the number five spot of the best mechanical keyboards of 2024 is the AO 5075 B+, coming in at a price tag of $99.99. If you want to check out any of the five keyboards in this video, there are Amazon links below for the US, UK, Canada, and international links. But let's jump into the AO 5075 B+ now. This is a 75% form factor that has a two-piece plastic case design that does have quite a bit of flex, but also has bright and well-diffused RGB accents on the sides. There's dongle storage on the rear and a knob with tactile bumps. This is also gasket mounted and for dampening, there is silicone in the case, a switch dampening pad, as well as more silicone between the plate and the PCB. This is very nice. The dampening makes the sound high quality, and overall I like the way it sounds; it sounds very ACO. But when picking up the case, it doesn't feel super expensive, and that's really the only reason that it's in the number five spot. The plastics do feel cheaper, but the overall product, the typing experience, and the sound of it are great, so it's kind of hard to knock that, but also it is what it is.\n",
        "\n",
        "Now switches are a big reason that this keyboard made it onto the list. These use AO's own switches and you have a choice between AO's V3 cream yellow Pros which are linear, V3 cream blue Pro switches which are tactiles, and the V3 silver Pros which is what I have, and probably my favorite for this keyboard. The silvers have a fantastic bottom-out feel, that's really quite nice for both gaming and typing. They are a lighter linear switch that's probably the most suited for gaming of the AO lineup, or definitely in that category of a great gaming switch. They are smooth, and really I don't think anyone will be unhappy with these switch options. But if you do end up wanting to change your switches out, this is fully hot swappable with three and five-pin switches.\n",
        "\n",
        "As for keycaps, this is classic AO. They use their ASA profile keycaps here, they are double shot PBT for these are great keycaps. They have nice printing, great thickness, and a slightly grippy texture. Overall, a really nice set of keycaps for this price point. However, if you've ever had an AO keyboard before, this is nothing new, so this might not even make it onto your choice because well, AO really hasn't updated these keycaps or changed anything really over the last couple of years, which isn't a bad thing. This is a fantastic option, but if you want something new and you already have AO's ASA profile keycaps, you might not be as attracted to this option.\n",
        "\n",
        "Now let's talk stabilizers. These are very well-tuned as well as being lubed from the factory, with only a slight tick on the backspace specifically. Overall, very good. I really like AO's purple stabilizers; these are great. But don't take my word for it, take a listen to the sound test. And that is how it sounds. Also, stick around to the end of the video for a back-to-back sound test of all the keyboards.\n",
        "\n",
        "Now for connectivity, this is wired with a USB type C or wireless with Bluetooth 5.0, or wireless for gaming with a 2.4 GHz USB dongle. So, you have pretty much every option there. And the cherry on top of all that is this has south-facing LEDs. So, overall, a great keyboard to mod with. Really, the only con being that the case does feel a little bit cheap and it's a little bit flexible, although that might actually be better for the feeling of the keyboard on the desk. Who knows? I think it may add to it.\n",
        "\n",
        "Lastly, the RGB here is great. It's nice and bright and vibrant. There's tons of modes, there's static colors, it's per-key lighting, it's exactly what you'd expect here. But with that, let's move on to the number four spot, and that is the Royal Axe R100, coming in at a price tag of $99.99. You get a lot for your money here. Now this switches it up to a 95% form factor which is fantastic if you want basically all of the keys you're going to need but you still want a more compact design so that you have more desk space. Maybe for like a larger mouse pad or just other things on your desk. However, you can also get this exact same keyboard in different form factors; you can get this in a full-size TKL and even a 65%, although I do think the 95% is just kind of the coolest one.\n",
        "\n",
        "Now for the build, the case is a single plastic shell with a top bump on the rear to act as a riser that also has integrated dongle storage which is super nice to access the dongle with the keyboard sitting on your desk without visually like messing up the design. So, you literally just have the keyboard on, pull it out, very very good. It then has swooping designs on the sides as well as glossy accents and finally, there is a switch for Mac versus Windows as well as a gold knob/switch thing for toggling between different connection modes, which is very very satisfying to click. That'll be in the sound test coming up. Overall, it's unique and it looks custom, definitely more so than the AO. Really, the only con I can see with the build as it feels solid, is because of the design for the bump out, this is consistently in a slightly raised-up angle. So if you do prefer a flatter keyboard, there's no adjustability there, and really that's the only con with the build. Now, as for dampening, there's some silicone between the plate and the PCB. Now colorways here are actually very cool. You saw I got that kind of like brown gold one which I think looks sick, but there's others: Whale Blue, Night Crimson, and Starry Cyan. The one that I got was the Lava Brown, so there's definitely a lot for I would say most people's preferences. If you definitely like a louder keyboard that's very very cool and custom looking, this one definitely delivers.\n",
        "\n",
        "Switches here use the Gaton G Pro 3.0 yellow switches. They are preed with an actuation force of 50 g, so they are a bit heavier than your traditional red switch but not by a crazy amount. They have some scratchiness but overall they are really really nice feeling. Overall, I'm happy with the switches, I think they match the keyboard pretty well. But if you want to get into modifying it, absolutely can because this is fully hot swappable with three and five-pin switches.\n",
        "\n",
        "Now for keycaps, the keycaps I believe are AK profile. They have great printing and a really nice thickness as well as a matte finish, kind of grippy texture. Overall, very satisfying for typing. Now let's talk stabilizers. The stabs are heavily lubed but not overdone, and they're tight in the plate, and honestly, they're tuned perfectly from the factory with no ticks or rattles. This has a slightly muted, creamy sound that I really really enjoy. But don't take my word for it, take a listen to the sound test. And that is how it sounds.\n",
        "\n",
        "Now as for connectivity, you can obviously use this with a USB type-C cable in its wired format or wirelessly with Bluetooth 5.0 or a 2.4 GHz USB dongle for gaming to get that high polling rate. As for RGBs, this does have North-facing LEDs, but the RGB is very bright and vibrant, has tons of modes, static colors are great, especially that orange. Just overall, very attractive. So, if you did want to do some sort of shine-through keycap, this is definitely a great option for that. But with that, let's move on to the number three spot, and this is the Apil Maker Brick 87, coming in at a price tag of $109.99. This is a very special keyboard. Obviously, by the name, it is Brick, so Legos, although not licensed I don't think. Now, this is a TKL form factor and is overall a super cool, quirky keyboard especially if you are a Lego lover like me. You can literally build off of your keyboard, like literally build off of it. The case is a two-piece plastic shell and there's a switch on the right side to switch connection modes and then one on the left to turn it on and off. Now one of the most interesting things is that this has two like roller scroll wheels on the bottom front chin of the keyboard. It's a very interesting place to put it, it's actually very cool. One of them is for volume control and the other one is for RGB brightness, uh, very cool integration, actually works pretty well. However, occasionally one of them gets a little bit stuck, so you kind of have to like push it a little bit harder, but you know it's cool that it's there. I'd rather have it than not have it. Then on top of that, you get that awesome glorious Lego bar which you can attach genuine Legos to it, and I did. Lego figures fit snugly and you can remove them if you want to totally customize it, so very very cool. Now, as for dampening, this has a ton of EVA foam in the case, a bunch of switch pads, a layer of cotton for more dampening between the plate and the PCB, and overall, I think they did a great job. I love the sound profile of this keyboard. It sounds like a custom, it sounds expensive, and it looks sweet, not only just because of the Lego bar but definitely some points up for that. For colorways, this actually comes in quite a few. You can get this in a clear Smokey black, a gray-green, a gray-pink, and then a white-purple. Now for switches, this uses EO Maker's own switches and I'm a fan of them. You have a choice between the Wisteria flamingos and Lily. These are all linear, or you can get Gaton Pro yellows. Now, of all those options, I would definitely pick EO makers over the Pro yellows, but I guess if you are a gamer, then yeah, you can get the yellows. I got the flamingos because I actually love the flamingos. I think it is an excellent switch for the price. However, there's no stock option for tactiles, so if you do want tactiles, you're going to have to modify it afterward. However, that's not a problem because obviously, this is fully compatible with three and five-pin switches. Now, all of these switches are factory lubed, and they did a great job here. It feels, feels, and sounds really good. The flamingos are definitely an enthusiast-grade switch; that's what I would call an enthusiast-grade switch, not like crazy crazy high but definitely in that realm. This is not like a budget budget switch. Now keycaps here, they are PBT with a very smooth texture and a matte finish. These again have a great thickness, though the printing is a little inconsistent in terms of like boldness. However, if you're not a stickler for that, the thickness on this does create a nice sound profile. The stabilizers here are well tuned and very well lubed. There is a very slight tick on the space bar, but that is slight. But overall, very well done. Don't take my word for it though, take a listen to the sound [Applause] test. And that is how it sounds. But with that, let's talk connectivity. You can use this wire with a USB type-C, wirelessly with Bluetooth 5.0, or a 2.4 GHz USB dongle. As for battery size, this has a 3,000 mAh battery. The RGB here is bright and well-diffused, there's tons of modes, static colors, it's really got everything you'd want, including south-facing LEDs which is not something I expected. But with that, let's move on to the number two spot, which is the Royal Cludge M75, coming at a price tag of $119.99. This is a 75% form factor, has a hefty two-piece plastic case with a metal knob, an extra USB-C when in wired mode, and a small OLED screen in the bottom right. The knob has nice tactile bumps and great functionality. When you press the knob, you can control the connectivity of the keyboard through the screen. The screen also shows battery, volume, as well as whether you're using Windows or Mac. Now for dampening, this is gasket mounted with foam between the polycarbonate plate and the PCB, a silicone switch dampening pad, and then a silicone mold in the case. Overall, very very good. I like the sound profile, which obviously sound test coming up. Now let's talk colorways, and there's a few things that we need to talk about with that. There is a purple which is the one that I have, which is the first release of this keyboard. Then there is a light gray, dark gray, or a green colorway. There are some notable updates to the other colorways such as south-facing LEDs and different switch and keycap options. Overall, it seems like they made better updates to the keyboard to make it even better for the price point, so I feel very confident recommending this keyboard even with the updated variation, especially if you want south-facing LEDs, a great thing to get. Now for switch options here, you have a choice between Browns which are obviously tactile, Reds, or speed Silvers, and that is for the purple colorway. For the other colorways, we have a choice between pale green switches which are tactile, or Vididian switches which are linear. The speed Silvers which I have are factory lubed. The switches here definitely have some scratchiness but overall not that scratchy and is a nice progressive feeling spring with a good weight, especially for gaming. As far as hot swap ability, this is fully hot swappable with three and five-pin switches. Keycaps here are double shot PBT non-shinethrough keycaps with side printing. The stabilizers here are very nicely tuned with no ticks or rattles. Overall, really impressed here. But don't take my word for a take a listen to the sound test. For connectivity, you can use this wire with a USB type-C or wirelessly with Bluetooth or a 2.4 GHz USB dongle. And as for the battery size, this is nicely sized at a 3,750 mAh battery. Now for RGB, because this uses a polycarbonate plate, it reflects the RGB quite nicely, making it very bright and vibrant. This also has tons of modes and colors and per-key lighting. And again, to reiterate, the purple colorway has North-facing LEDs and the other colorways have south-facing LEDs. But with that, moving on to the number one spot, this is the Yanai AL71, coming at a price tag of $99.99. This is the freaking steal of the century; an unbelievable keyboard, extraordinarily worthy of the number one spot. This uses a 68% form factor and for the build, there's a reason why this is in the number one spot. This has a two-piece solid aluminum shell. It is very heavy, solid, gasket-mounted, and it's got a decorative silver moon logo on the front right side, which I think looks great and really makes this feel more like a custom keyboard, which this really is. This is a custom keyboard. It also has side diffused RGB accents, which are actually pretty dang bright and look great, as well as a switch to toggle between Windows and Mac and another switch to change your connectivity modes. All the selections have nice tactile bumps and everything really on this keyboard just feels extremely premium and it sounds amazing. As for dampening, this also has a ton of switch pads, case dampening foam between the plate and the PCB. This has a lot of dampening, and because of that, it sounds nicely. Obviously, you can take out some of that if you want to change up the sound profile, which actually wouldn't be too hard because well, it's an aluminum case so it's a little bit easier to get into. For colorways, you actually have quite a few options which is kind of unexpected because the aluminum kind of you would expect that higher price point, but it's in a lower price point, not as many color options, but yeah it does well. You have a choice between black, blue, purple, green, pink, red, and silver. Now for switch options here, you have two options, you have the crystal white switches which is a lighter linear switch. I actually really liked them, or you have a silent switch. If you're really into the feel, the silent switches aren't going to be as great as they do have like a rubber stopper that does kind of soften the bottom out, so it's not going to feel as nice, but it sounds like basically no sound, still much better than a membrane keyboard but yeah, just take that into account. The crystals are very very smooth and have a great sound of them, so overall, I really enjoy this. However, since there's not a lot of switch options, if you do want to end up customizing your shelf and putting your own switches in there, it's fully hot swappable with three and five-pin switches. Now let's talk keycaps. These are PBT with a cherry profile, and that is something I really really enjoy. I like Cherry, it makes it feel more like a custom keyboard, which it is. I keep saying like a custom keyboard, This is a custom keyboard, let's be real. They have a slight texture to them, they're matte finish, and they have a good thickness. The stabs here are greased from the factory and are tuned very well, especially the space bar, guys I can't overdo that. You're going to hear in the sound test, really really good job. The only one with a slight issue was the backspace and has a slight tick but if you're not an enthusiast you may not even notice it's like that slight. Overall, I absolutely love the sound and feel of this board and for the price, you literally can't beat it, guys. There's a reason it's in the number one spot, but don't take my word for it, take a listen to the sound [Applause] test. And that is how it sounds. For connectivity, you can use this wire with a USB type-C or wirelessly with Bluetooth 5.0 or a 2.4 GHz USB dongle for gaming and on top of all of that, you're going to think okay, well the wireless connectivity, they're going to give you a small battery size, no, it's the biggest battery on the list. This uses a 4600 mAh battery, pretty freaking wild. For RGB, it's good here, it's bright, it's nice and vibrant, it's per-key lighting, it's pretty much exactly what you'd expect and again having those side RGB lights really adds a nice touch to it. And lastly, obviously because this has Cherry profile keycaps, this uses south-facing LEDs. What doesn't this keyboard have for this ridiculously good price tag? Again, if you want to check out any of the five keyboards in this video, there are Amazon links below for the US, UK, Canada, and international links. The AL71 absolutely blew me away, that is an unbelievable price for that keyboard. I really hope they don't increase the price because it seems too good to be true, but it is very good and it is true, at the time of filming.

        "    Jumping into the number five spot of the best mechanical keyboards of 2024 is the AO 5075 B+, coming in at a price tag of $99.99. If you want to check out any of the five keyboards in this video, there are Amazon links below for the US, UK, Canada, and international links. But let's jump into the AO 5075 B+ now. This is a 75% form factor that has a two-piece plastic case design that does have quite a bit of flex, but also has bright and well-diffused RGB accents on the sides. There's dongle storage on the rear and a knob with tactile bumps. This is also gasket mounted and for dampening, there is silicone in the case, a switch dampening pad, as well as more silicone between the plate and the PCB. This is very nice. The dampening makes the sound high quality, and overall I like the way it sounds; it sounds very ACO. But when picking up the case, it doesn't feel super expensive, and that's really the only reason that it's in the number five spot. The plastics do feel cheaper, but the overall product, the typing experience, and the sound of it are great, so it's kind of hard to knock that, but also it is what it is.\n",
        "\n",
        "Now switches are a big reason that this keyboard made it onto the list. These use AO's own switches and you have a choice between AO's V3 cream yellow Pros which are linear, V3 cream blue Pro switches which are tactiles, and the V3 silver Pros which is what I have, and probably my favorite for this keyboard. The silvers have a fantastic bottom-out feel, that's really quite nice for both gaming and typing. They are a lighter linear switch that's probably the most suited for gaming of the AO lineup, or definitely in that category of a great gaming switch. They are smooth, and really I don't think anyone will be unhappy with these switch options. But if you do end up wanting to change your switches out, this is fully hot swappable with three and five-pin switches.\n",
        "\n",
        "As for keycaps, this is classic AO. They use their ASA profile keycaps here, they are double shot PBT for these are great keycaps. They have nice printing, great thickness, and a slightly grippy texture. Overall, a really nice set of keycaps for this price point. However, if you've ever had an AO keyboard before, this is nothing new, so this might not even make it onto your choice because well, AO really hasn't updated these keycaps or changed anything really over the last couple of years, which isn't a bad thing. This is a fantastic option, but if you want something new and you already have AO's ASA profile keycaps, you might not be as attracted to this option.\n",
        "\n",
        "Now let's talk stabilizers. These are very well-tuned as well as being lubed from the factory, with only a slight tick on the backspace specifically. Overall, very good. I really like AO's purple stabilizers; these are great. But don't take my word for it, take a listen to the sound test. And that is how it sounds. Also, stick around to the end of the video for a back-to-back sound test of all the keyboards.\n",
        "\n",
        "Now for connectivity, this is wired with a USB type C or wireless with Bluetooth 5.0, or wireless for gaming with a 2.4 GHz USB dongle. So, you have pretty much every option there. And the cherry on top of all that is this has south-facing LEDs. So, overall, a great keyboard to mod with. Really, the only con being that the case does feel a little bit cheap and it's a little bit flexible, although that might actually be better for the feeling of the keyboard on the desk. Who knows? I think it may add to it.\n",
        "\n",
        "Lastly, the RGB here is great. It's nice and bright and vibrant. There's tons of modes, there's static colors, it's per-key lighting, it's exactly what you'd expect here. But with that, let's move on to the number four spot, and that is the Royal Axe R100, coming in at a price tag of $99.99. You get a lot for your money here. Now this switches it up to a 95% form factor which is fantastic if you want basically all of the keys you're going to need but you still want a more compact design so that you have more desk space. Maybe for like a larger mouse pad or just other things on your desk. However, you can also get this exact same keyboard in different form factors; you can get this in a full-size TKL and even a 65%, although I do think the 95% is just kind of the coolest one.\n",
        "\n",
        "Now for the build, the case is a single plastic shell with a top bump on the rear to act as a riser that also has integrated dongle storage which is super nice to access the dongle with the keyboard sitting on your desk without visually like messing up the design. So, you literally just have the keyboard on, pull it out, very very good. It then has swooping designs on the sides as well as glossy accents and finally, there is a switch for Mac versus Windows as well as a gold knob/switch thing for toggling between different connection modes, which is very very satisfying to click. That'll be in the sound test coming up. Overall, it's unique and it looks custom, definitely more so than the AO. Really, the only con I can see with the build as it feels solid, is because of the design for the bump out, this is consistently in a slightly raised-up angle. So if you do prefer a flatter keyboard, there's no adjustability there, and really that's the only con with the build. Now, as for dampening, there's some silicone between the plate and the PCB. Now colorways here are actually very cool. You saw I got that kind of like brown gold one which I think looks sick, but there's others: Whale Blue, Night Crimson, and Starry Cyan. The one that I got was the Lava Brown, so there's definitely a lot for I would say most people's preferences. If you definitely like a louder keyboard that's very very cool and custom looking, this one definitely delivers.\n",
        "\n",
        "Switches here use the Gaton G Pro 3.0 yellow switches. They are preed with an actuation force of 50 g, so they are a bit heavier than your traditional red switch but not by a crazy amount. They have some scratchiness but overall they are really really nice feeling. Overall, I'm happy with the switches, I think they match the keyboard pretty well. But if you want to get into modifying it, absolutely can because this is fully hot swappable with three and five-pin switches.\n",
        "\n",
        "Now for keycaps, the keycaps I believe are AK profile. They have great printing and a really nice thickness as well as a matte finish, kind of grippy texture. Overall, very satisfying for typing. Now let's talk stabilizers. The stabs are heavily lubed but not overdone, and they're tight in the plate, and honestly, they're tuned perfectly from the factory with no ticks or rattles. This has a slightly muted, creamy sound that I really really enjoy. But don't take my word for it, take a listen to the sound test. And that is how it sounds.\n",
        "\n",
        "Now as for connectivity, you can obviously use this with a USB type-C cable in its wired format or wirelessly with Bluetooth 5.0 or a 2.4 GHz USB dongle for gaming to get that high polling rate. As for RGBs, this does have North-facing LEDs, but the RGB is very bright and vibrant, has tons of modes, static colors are great, especially that orange. Just overall, very attractive. So, if you did want to do some sort of shine-through keycap, this is definitely a great option for that. But with that, let's move on to the number three spot, and this is the Apil Maker Brick 87, coming in at a price tag of $109.99. This is a very special keyboard. Obviously, by the name, it is Brick, so Legos, although not licensed I don't think. Now, this is a TKL form factor and is overall a super cool, quirky keyboard especially if you are a Lego lover like me. You can literally build off of your keyboard, like literally build off of it. The case is a two-piece plastic shell and there's a switch on the right side to switch connection modes and then one on the left to turn it on and off. Now one of the most interesting things is that this has two like roller scroll wheels on the bottom front chin of the keyboard. It's a very interesting place to put it, it's actually very cool. One of them is for volume control and the other one is for RGB brightness, uh, very cool integration, actually works pretty well. However, occasionally one of them gets a little bit stuck, so you kind of have to like push it a little bit harder, but you know it's cool that it's there. I'd rather have it than not have it. Then on top of that, you get that awesome glorious Lego bar which you can attach genuine Legos to it, and I did. Lego figures fit snugly and you can remove them if you want to totally customize it, so very very cool. Now, as for dampening, this has a ton of EVA foam in the case, a bunch of switch pads, a layer of cotton for more dampening between the plate and the PCB, and overall, I think they did a great job. I love the sound profile of this keyboard. It sounds like a custom, it sounds expensive, and it looks sweet, not only just because of the Lego bar but definitely some points up for that. For colorways, this actually comes in quite a few. You can get this in a clear Smokey black, a gray-green, a gray-pink, and then a white-purple. Now for switches, this uses EO Maker's own switches and I'm a fan of them. You have a choice between the Wisteria flamingos and Lily. These are all linear, or you can get Gaton Pro yellows. Now, of all those options, I would definitely pick EO makers over the Pro yellows, but I guess if you are a gamer, then yeah, you can get the yellows. I got the flamingos because I actually love the flamingos. I think it is an excellent switch for the price. However, there's no stock option for tactiles, so if you do want tactiles, you're going to have to modify it afterward. However, that's not a problem because obviously, this is fully compatible with three and five-pin switches. Now, all of these switches are factory lubed, and they did a great job here. It feels, feels, and sounds really good. The flamingos are definitely an enthusiast-grade switch; that's what I would call an enthusiast-grade switch, not like crazy crazy high but definitely in that realm. This is not like a budget budget switch. Now keycaps here, they are PBT with a very smooth texture and a matte finish. These again have a great thickness, though the printing is a little inconsistent in terms of like boldness. However, if you're not a stickler for that, the thickness on this does create a nice sound profile. The stabilizers here are well tuned and very well lubed. There is a very slight tick on the space bar, but that is slight. But overall, very well done. Don't take my word for it though, take a listen to the sound [Applause] test. And that is how it sounds. But with that, let's talk connectivity. You can use this wire with a USB type-C, wirelessly with Bluetooth 5.0, or a 2.4 GHz USB dongle. As for battery size, this has a 3,000 mAh battery. The RGB here is bright and well-diffused, there's tons of modes, static colors, it's really got everything you'd want, including south-facing LEDs which is not something I expected. But with that, let's move on to the number two spot, which is the Royal Cludge M75, coming at a price tag of $119.99. This is a 75% form factor, has a hefty two-piece plastic case with a metal knob, an extra USB-C when in wired mode, and a small OLED screen in the bottom right. The knob has nice tactile bumps and great functionality. When you press the knob, you can control the connectivity of the keyboard through the screen. The screen also shows battery, volume, as well as whether you're using Windows or Mac. Now for dampening, this is gasket mounted with foam between the polycarbonate plate and the PCB, a silicone switch dampening pad, and then a silicone mold in the case. Overall, very very good. I like the sound profile, which obviously sound test coming up. Now let's talk colorways, and there's a few things that we need to talk about with that. There is a purple which is the one that I have, which is the first release of this keyboard. Then there is a light gray, dark gray, or a green colorway. There are some notable updates to the other colorways such as south-facing LEDs and different switch and keycap options. Overall, it seems like they made better updates to the keyboard to make it even better for the price point, so I feel very confident recommending this keyboard even with the updated variation, especially if you want south-facing LEDs, a great thing to get. Now for switch options here, you have a choice between Browns which are obviously tactile, Reds, or speed Silvers, and that is for the purple colorway. For the other colorways, we have a choice between pale green switches which are tactile, or Vididian switches which are linear. The speed Silvers which I have are factory lubed. The switches here definitely have some scratchiness but overall not that scratchy and is a nice progressive feeling spring with a good weight, especially for gaming. As far as hot swap ability, this is fully hot swappable with three and five-pin switches. Keycaps here are double shot PBT non-shinethrough keycaps with side printing. The stabilizers here are very nicely tuned with no ticks or rattles. Overall, really impressed here. But don't take my word for a take a listen to the sound test. For connectivity, you can use this wire with a USB type-C or wirelessly with Bluetooth or a 2.4 GHz USB dongle. And as for the battery size, this is nicely sized at a 3,750 mAh battery. Now for RGB, because this uses a polycarbonate plate, it reflects the RGB quite nicely, making it very bright and vibrant. This also has tons of modes and colors and per-key lighting. And again, to reiterate, the purple colorway has North-facing LEDs and the other colorways have south-facing LEDs. But with that, moving on to the number one spot, this is the Yanai AL71, coming at a price tag of $99.99. This is the freaking steal of the century; an unbelievable keyboard, extraordinarily worthy of the number one spot. This uses a 68% form factor and for the build, there's a reason why this is in the number one spot. This has a two-piece solid aluminum shell. It is very heavy, solid, gasket-mounted, and it's got a decorative silver moon logo on the front right side, which I think looks great and really makes this feel more like a custom keyboard, which this really is. This is a custom keyboard. It also has side diffused RGB accents, which are actually pretty dang bright and look great, as well as a switch to toggle between Windows and Mac and another switch to change your connectivity modes. All the selections have nice tactile bumps and everything really on this keyboard just feels extremely premium and it sounds amazing. As for dampening, this also has a ton of switch pads, case dampening foam between the plate and the PCB. This has a lot of dampening, and because of that, it sounds nicely. Obviously, you can take out some of that if you want to change up the sound profile, which actually wouldn't be too hard because well, it's an aluminum case so it's a little bit easier to get into. For colorways, you actually have quite a few options which is kind of unexpected because the aluminum kind of you would expect that higher price point, but it's in a lower price point, not as many color options, but yeah it does well. You have a choice between black, blue, purple, green, pink, red, and silver. Now for switch options here, you have two options, you have the crystal white switches which is a lighter linear switch. I actually really liked them, or you have a silent switch. If you're really into the feel, the silent switches aren't going to be as great as they do have like a rubber stopper that does kind of soften the bottom out, so it's not going to feel as nice, but it sounds like basically no sound, still much better than a membrane keyboard but yeah, just take that into account. The crystals are very very smooth and have a great sound of them, so overall, I really enjoy this. However, since there's not a lot of switch options, if you do want to end up customizing your shelf and putting your own switches in there, it's fully hot swappable with three and five-pin switches. Now let's talk keycaps. These are PBT with a cherry profile, and that is something I really really enjoy. I like Cherry, it makes it feel more like a custom keyboard, which it is. I keep saying like a custom keyboard, This is a custom keyboard, let's be real. They have a slight texture to them, they're matte finish, and they have a good thickness. The stabs here are greased from the factory and are tuned very well, especially the space bar, guys I can't overdo that. You're going to hear in the sound test, really really good job. The only one with a slight issue was the backspace and has a slight tick but if you're not an enthusiast you may not even notice it's like that slight. Overall, I absolutely love the sound and feel of this board and for the price, you literally can't beat it, guys. There's a reason it's in the number one spot, but don't take my word for it, take a listen to the sound [Applause] test. And that is how it sounds. For connectivity, you can use this wire with a USB type-C or wirelessly with Bluetooth 5.0 or a 2.4 GHz USB dongle for gaming and on top of all of that, you're going to think okay, well the wireless connectivity, they're going to give you a small battery size, no, it's the biggest battery on the list. This uses a 4600 mAh battery, pretty freaking wild. For RGB, it's good here, it's bright, it's nice and vibrant, it's per-key lighting, it's pretty much exactly what you'd expect and again having those side RGB lights really adds a nice touch to it. And lastly, obviously because this has Cherry profile keycaps, this uses south-facing LEDs. What doesn't this keyboard have for this ridiculously good price tag? Again, if you want to check out any of the five keyboards in this video, there are Amazon links below for the US, UK, Canada, and international links. The AL71 absolutely blew me away, that is an unbelievable price for that keyboard. I really hope they don't increase the price because it seems too good to be true, but it is very good and it is true, at the time of filming. But yeah, this is Consumer Deck review, and I'll see you guys in the next one.\n",

        "    Having the right keyboard can completely change your gaming experience, so in this video, I'm going to break down my top five best gaming keyboards so that you'll never have to suffer through unresponsive experiences again. Now, the issue is that a keyboard might work great for your best friend but might not be the best for you, and that's just because most keyboards are not made with the same people in mind. So that's why I made sure to include options really for all types of situations. Regardless of what you're looking for, I'll have the perfect gaming keyboard for you. And all the links to find the best prices on all of the products that will be mentioned in this video are in the description below. The keyboards mentioned in this video are in no exact order, so be sure to stay tuned until the end so that you don't miss anything. First up, I have the Asus ROG Strix Scope 296. Now, this one is my choice for the best gaming keyboard for most people. The Asus ROG Strix Scope 296 really stands out as a fantastic gaming keyboard with its ergonomic and compact design, sound-dampening foam, pre-lubed keyboard stabilizers, enhanced keystroke stability, and tri-mode connectivity. The Strix Scope 296 has an ergonomic design that has three tilt positions and a detachable wrist rest. Now, not to mention, it has a layout that retains all function and number keys in a more compact and efficient layout. It also has sound-dampening foam with switch dampening pads. Now, this allows the structure to absorb the pinging noises and echoes to improve keystroke acoustics. The Strix Scope 296 has pre-lubed keyboard stabilizers. Now, these help to ensure less friction for smoother keystrokes and stability for longer keys. It also enhances keystroke stability and acoustics through its pre-lubed NX Snow linear switch and ROG NX Storm clicky switches. With tri-mode connectivity, the Strix Scope 296 really ensures that you have a stable connection with 2.4 GHz ROG Speed Nova wireless technology, Bluetooth technology, or even wired USB. It also has a UV-coated space bar that has special ROG markings and three underside RGB LEDs for those looking to spice up their gaming station.\n",
